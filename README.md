This repository contains a  version of the "Forestry Carbon Offsets in Africa" dashboard, originally created using ArcGIS Dashboards. The original dashboard, accessible at [https://www.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/b5643ccc67f14c0b8ade84701720ba25](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/b5643ccc67f14c0b8ade84701720ba25), was developed by Katongole Umar Geoyouthmappers (Same Author), Uganda, to showcase forest carbon offset areas in Africa, with a focus on improving forestry and wildlife conservation.

This code is built using raw HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, leveraging the ArcGIS API for JavaScript to recreate the map and widgets. It is designed to be hosted on GitHub Pages or any static web server.
